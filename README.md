# JIRA Release Note Generator üöÄ

This project aims to simplify the process of generating release notes in .html format using data from a CSV file obtained through JIRA. By following this guide, you'll be able to filter JIRA issues, extract relevant information, and create organized release notes for different subcategories.

## Introduction
This project is designed to generate release notes by using a CSV file sourced from the Atlassian's JIRA platform. The release notes will be generated in .html format, providing an easily readable and shareable format for your team or stakeholders.

## Input and Output Formats

**Input**: .csv
**Output**: .html
**Script Language used** : Python

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following items are considered.

1. **Custom Field for Release Notes**: Set up a custom field in JIRA to capture the release note content for each issue. Contact your JIRA administrator to create a custom field in JIRA for release notes. Say the field name as **Release Note**. 
To add a custom field in JIRA, refer [here](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/create-a-custom-field/).

2. **Custom JIRA Query**: Prepare a custom search query in JIRA to filter the release note issues required for a release. To create a custom JIRA query, refer [here](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/manage-custom-filters-in-team-managed-projects/).

3. **CSV File from JIRA**: Obtain a CSV file from the JIRA portal containing the necessary issue details. While downloading a CSV file, select Export CSV (all fields)

5. **Python Environment**: Install Python and a code editor such as PyCharm. For detailed tutorial, refer [here](https://www.guru99.com/how-to-install-python.html).

6. **Basic Python Knowledge**: A fundamental understanding of Python coding concepts will be beneficial.

## Configuration Steps

Follow these steps to configure and utilize the JIRA Release Note Generator:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **CSV Import and Parsing**: Import the CSV file obtained from JIRA into the project. Use Python to parse the CSV file and extract the necessary information.

4. **Filtering with Custom Query**: Implement the custom JIRA query to filter the relevant release note issues according to your project's criteria.

5. **Categorization**: Utilize the query parameters to categorize the filtered issues into subcategories such as Web, Mobile Platforms, What's New, Fixed Issues, and Known Issues.

6. **HTML Release Notes Generation**: Generate .html release notes using the categorized issue data. You can use Python's HTML templating libraries to structure the release notes effectively.

7. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script to generate the release notes in .html format. Ensure that the script captures the custom field content for each issue.

8. **Review and Share**: Open the generated .html release notes in a web browser to review the outcome. Share these organized release notes with your team or stakeholders to keep them informed about the changes in your project.
